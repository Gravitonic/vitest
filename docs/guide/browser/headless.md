# Headless

Headless mode is another option available in the browser mode. In headless mode, the browser runs in the background without a user interface, which makes it useful for running automated tests. The headless option in Vitest can be set to a boolean value to enable or disable headless mode.

Here's an example configuration enabling headless mode:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    browser: {
      provider: 'playwright',
      enabled: true,
      headless: true,
    },
  }
})
```

You can also set headless mode using the `--browser.headless` flag in the CLI, like this:

```sh
npx vitest --browser.name=chrome --browser.headless
```

In this case, Vitest will run in headless mode using the Chrome browser.

::: warning
Headless mode is not available by default. You need to use either [`playwright`](https://npmjs.com/package/playwright) or [`webdriverio`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriverio) providers to enable this feature.
